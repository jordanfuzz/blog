I have a lot of things coming up and just wanted to give a glimpse into my roadmap for how I plan to spend my time. I struggle with consistency, so I imagine the order here won't stay super strict.

## Games

While there's a lot of games I want to play soon, and I could list their order, I really need to get back to my projects after the next one or two. So this is my shortened list.

First up is **Final Fantasy VII**. I've made it most of the way through this game already (loving it), but I actually have a deadline for this one. **Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children** is being re-released in theaters and I have never seen it. I want to finish the game before going to see the movie on _February 21st_.

I have played through the first 60% or so of this game in the past, but for some reason I didn't remember much, so it's like I'm playing it for the first time. We'll see how it ranks up against my other favorite games, but this game has S-tier story and characters.

Once I finish this and see the movie in theaters, I will definitely be interested in playing through the remake games, but who knows if that'll be before or after I pick up some of my project to-dos.

## Projects

**Colors TCG Page** - First up is this page. I've mentioned it elsewhere on my site, but I recently found an interest in an internet collectible card game called [Colors TCG](https://colors-tcg.eu/). Follow the link to learn more, but a core part of that "game" is to have a dedicated page for trading and displaying your collection. I'd like to add that here.

**Server Side Rendering** - So if it's not obvious already, this site, although small, has a lot of bloat because it's a full React app. This hasn't caused me any pain really, and in most cases it's plenty small for the average viewer. But I've been wanting to implement Server Side Rendering for a while, because many people in the old web community pull data from a page's raw html and css, and since my page is a React app, that can complicate things. So I want to implement **Next.js** on my site to make it quicker and more "plain-html" friendly.

**Blog Reader View** - My main site (at least at the time of writing) is more of a just-for-fun project and I can get why people wouldn't want to scroll through and read full posts here with its current aesthetic. I eventually intend to share these posts with people I know, and I think it would be for the best if there was a cleaner blog view for just my posts that didn't have the same colorful aggression that this site has.

**Cleanup and Re-host other projects** - My [links](https://gloogo.io/links) page is still pretty empty, because I haven't polished up my current projects. Most of them are pretty close to being ready for hosting, but still need a bit of work.

**Pokecodex** - Ugh. [This project](https://github.com/jordanfuzz/pokecodex) has become a beast. It's come so far and it's honestly pretty close to being useable. But with its size, it takes a very long time to make meaningful changes. I've gotten really distracted from the whole Pokemon Journey thing anyway, but I imagine I'll come around to it and finish it up. This needs to get done, otherwise I will have spent all those hours for nothing!

## Other plans

I have so many things that I want to work on. So many half-finished projects and registered domain names. 2023 was pretty successful in actually finishing a few of them. If I can improve on that pace this year I'll be in good shape.

I'm going to be going back to Copenhagen in March, and I'm sure that will slow things down a bit too, but I ain't apologizin'!

As usual, if you have questions about any of my projects or want to chat about this stuff, [contact me](https://gloogo.io/contact)! I'm always happy to chat.
