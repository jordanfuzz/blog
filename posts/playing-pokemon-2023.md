Kind of funny that my first actual blog post is about Pok√©mon, but that's what's on my mind so here it is.

I've been playing Pok√©mon for more than 20 years at this point, but with the current state of the franchise, it's been a _looong_ time since I've had this much fun with it. I recently started playing again starting with Yellow, and it's not just the nostalgia; **those games are good.**

So I've started a fresh playthrough of all the games, and I plan on catching everything. I plan on creating a [living dex](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Living_Pok%C3%A9dex) in every generation. I already have a living dex in Pok√©mon Home, but that includes a few Pok√©mon that I've traded for. I want all of them to be _mine_ originally. Not only that, but I plan on catching every gender variant, every regional form, every unique source of Pok√©mon that you can get. **Basically, if a Pok√©mon is unique in how it is obtained or how it looks, I'm going to catch it.**

This is a lot of information to track, and there's a lot of Pok√©mon out there. And so... I built something to help. üòé

## Gotta Catch 'Em All

I built an [app](https://pokecodex.com) to help me track all of this. This allows me to track all Pok√©mon and all their sources across all the games, including spin-offs.

That link won't be live for a few more days after posting this, but I plan on hosting it soon. It should be noted that while this is in beta, it's going to be restricted based on membership in our local Discord. If you want early access to the app, please [contact me](https://gloogo.io/contact) and I might be able to invite you, although I can't make promises until it's fully released.

To prepare for this, I've done a lot of research and discovered several cool facts about early Pok√©mon games, and there are a LOT of things that I've either forgotten, or never knew about the franchise. So not only am I going to catch everything, I want to _experience_ everything!

Here's what I want to accomplish:

1. 100% living dex in every game
2. Catch all variants and unique sources
3. Catch a few ultra-rare shinies (like Manaphy)
4. Beat all endgame challenges (Battle Frontier, Ribbons, etc.)
5. Experience all mini-games, secrets, battles, and cutscenes.
6. Complete all of the above with legitimate physical hardware (no emulation)

There are a lot of specifics, details, and rules about this playthrough, and I have a friend who is doing this challenge with me, so I may make a separate post that includes just the restrictions and goals of the challenge.

## Cozy Pok√©mon Vibes

It sounds like a lot, and is definitely going to be a long and difficult process, but it's been an absolute blast so far. **Old Pok√©mon games are just so much better.** I've been actually challenged by the franchise for the first time in probably ten years. Collecting and playing on old hardware has also been so much fun.

The first few gens of this playthrough, I'm going to be playing on either my N64 for Stadium game exclusives, or my **Analogue Pocket** for all of the Game Boy games. I have been so pleased with my Pocket, it's been so delightful to play with, and makes streaming and recording _on official hardware_ a breeze.

## Going Forward

So yeah, this Pok√©dex Tracker is what I've been working on, and Pok√©mon is what I've been playing. This is going to take me a long time, but it's going to be a fun and memorable journey. I'm sure I'll post updates or more details on the challenge later. I could talk forever about this topic, but it's already feeling long winded, so I'll stop here.

If for any reason anyone is reading this and actually has interest, I will _sometimes_ be streaming this progress [on my Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/gloogo). Keep in mind that **I am not a streamer**, I'm just doing this for fun and may be online doing it sometimes.

Done something similar or have interest in the challenge? Get in [contact](https://gloogo.io/contact), I'd love to chat about it!
