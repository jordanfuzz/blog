Okay! It took me way too long to get around to this, but I need to talk about the second half of my Europe trip this winter.

Near the end of December my family few into Denmark from the States and we headed to Finland together for the holidays after a few days of touring some of the major sites in Copenhagen that they hadn't seen yet.

## Joensuu

Joensuu was our first stop. Similar to my hometown, Joensuu is a city but it still has a small town feel to it, or at least that was my impression of it in my short time there. Just because of how quiet it was, I guess. **Sofia**, our former-exchange-student-now-adopted-sister is from Joensuu and has family there, so we were spending the holidays there with them. ❤️

Unfortunately, my wife and I both got pretty sick over Christmas and New Years. She got it much worse than me, and the night of Christmas itself was spent trying to keep her fever down. With that and the weather, we didn't do much exploring. But Sofia and her family took us around the city center which was nice.

Most of my photos of Joensuu are of family, and I haven't asked permission to post those yet. But just picture a snowy, cozy cottage with the tackiest wallpaper you've ever seen and that was our AirBnB.

## Helsinki

After Christmas, the rest of us went to Helsinki again, and my wife and I started feeling better so we were able to do a bit more exploring.

The Helsinki Central Library Oodi was honestly a very interesting stop. My wife obviously enjoyed the unique architecture, but personally I was impressed because I had never seen such an advanced library! In addition to the standard amenities offered in the libraries I've been to, they offered musical instrument rentals and recording rooms, 3D printers, video game console rooms, large blueprint and poster printers, etc. And the top floor had little wheeled robots who would collect bins of books and bring them between floors with an elevator.

Okay, just a couple more photos and then I'll wrap this up. Exploring downtown Helsinki was great! Amos Rex, Alvar Aalto buildings, the harbor, and a half dozen [Moomin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomins) stores left us pretty busy on our few days there. Since my wife is an architect, I've gone with her to see lots of different notable buildings from famous architects, but the Aalto house was one of my favorites that I've seen. I appreciate livable, comfortable design and not just artistic design for art's sake.

I actually have a lot more photos I want to share, but my site isn't really set up for that quite yet. I have plans for a better photo viewing section but haven't gotten around to it. Eventually I'll post quite a few more.

## Going back

I've been back in the states since early January, but my wife's program doesn't end until July/August, so I'm still going to be going back and forth between here and Denmark. I'll be there for another month or so starting in March. I think next stop on our list is probably Germany. Or maybe a quick trip to Sweden since it's so close.

This post was pretty lengthy, and I'm not sure why I'm including a few of the more boring details. But TL;DR, we enjoyed our stay in Finland. We both said we'd happily return. Maybe this time we'd venture further north into Lapland to see the northern lights finally?
