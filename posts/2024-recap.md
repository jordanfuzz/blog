Happy New Year! This is going to be a long one, TL;DR at the end!

Okay, a whole bunch of stuff happened this year, let's start with the eclipse!

## Solar Eclipse

In April, we went to visit family who live on a great little farm out in Arkansas since they live in the path of the eclipse. They are some of my favorite people and, major celestial event aside, I had such a great time experiencing such a different, wholesome lifestyle.

## Two organs down, 76 to go...

Okay, after that, things started getting crazy. I ended up having emergency gallbladder surgery (paired with pancreatitis and liver problems) that left me in the hospital for a week. And immediately following that adventure, I was laid off at work. Which is funny because **THE SAME THING HAPPENED A YEAR AGO**.

One year prior I spent a week in the hospital, and then immediately my whole team got laid off, and here I was again. But, like last time, it was a blessing in disguise. It led to a new job, and things are better than they were last year.

> No hospital photo, because no one wants to see that.

## After that...

All that chaos happened right before our move back to Philly. My wife finished [her gap year in Denmark](https://gloogo.io/blog/copenhagen-part-1), and so we planned our return to Philadelphia. 🤢 We'll be here just a little bit longer, but at least our apartment is a bit nicer this time around. Also, I picked the guitar back up after not playing for years!

> New guitar! Nothing fancy, but feels great :)

Riiiight before we went back to Philadelphia, my family took a trip to New Mexico and the Four Corners region of the US. My brother served a mission in this area, and he knew some people out here. There's a good amount of history and interesting sites out here, and some of us had never been, so we took a small road trip.

And now, the most important update of the year...

**I hit level 99 fishing in Old School Runescape!**

This has been a dream ever since I was a kid. Fishing was my jam, and this is my first 99 ever in OSRS. And not only that, but I got both fishing pets, the fish sack, and the golden tench! Look how fashionable I am!

I know exactly 2 people will ever read this post, and of those two people, 0 of them will care about this achievement, but this felt great. ❤️

## PAX and my TCG addiction

I know any other event pales in comparison to 99 fishing, but I think PAX Unplugged was also worth mentioning.

PAX Unplugged is a convention for tabletop and board games. While I was there I:

- Relearned how to play Magic The Gathering (thanks Jill for being my partner!)
- Got a billion TCG handouts which fueled my TCG addiction (more later)
- Attended a [ProZD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6MFZAOHXlKK1FI7V0XQVeA) Q&A
- Saw a billion board game demos
- Bought some junk

My biggest takeaway from attending this year is _going to board game conventions by yourself is kind of lame._ Laurel was busy with school, so I had to go alone. Next time maybe I'll find some friends.

I looked, and I actually don't have any decent photos of PAX, other than things that I bought, so take a look at my negg!

I have another post coming soon about my trading card collection, and I'll share more at that time, but TL;DR for PAX: I went, and I got some stuff.

**OH! I got StreetPass hits while I was there! You can't overstate the hype!**

## Christmas

And last, but never, ever least: **Christmas!** Winter coziness is my jam, and this holiday really quenched my winter thirst. Sofia was here for Christmas, but unfortunately Laurel was not. She went home to China to see family as well.

> Yeah, maybe I'll post our Christmas tree photo every year, who cares?

It was nice being back in Utah with family and the mountains. We saw the Nutcracker. What is that even about? A ballet about a girl who gets a toy and then dreams about a ballet? Snoozefest! I refuse to believe it's my lack of cultural sophistication that's keeping me from enjoying that type of performance.

But! Check this out, my parents got me a copy of Nintendo Power Magazine Vol 173, _with the Eon Ticket!_

> Eon Ticket card in the Nintendo Power Magazine

For context, the Eon Ticket was a special distribution that allowed you to scan in the card with the e-Reader to be able to catch Latios and Latias in your Ruby and Sapphire game! This magazine was in excellent condition and had the ticket untouched. In a few days I'm going to record pulling this out and using it. 😎

## New Year 2025

Okay, looking forward. This year is gonna be full of mystery. We're done with school in just a couple of months and then... **???**

Who knows what's next... Maybe we'll start trying for a baby, maybe we'll move to New York for Laurel's work, maybe we'll come back to Utah for a bit, it's hard to say.

Some minor plans I'm looking forward to:

- Upgrading my home server
- Get more of my projects onto the internet for real this time
- Finish Final Fantasy Rebirth
- Play a ton more Pokemon (Analogue 3D coming soon!)

## TL;DR

This year I:

- Saw a solar eclipse
- Got my gallbladder removed
- Got laid off
- Got a new job
- Went on a road trip
- Started learning guitar again
- Hit level 99 fishing in OSRS
- Went to PAX
- Had a great Christmas

Wow, even my TL;DR is long. I'm grateful that my year was so full of memorable events. I'd like to do a better job of documenting my notable moments in life (and then maybe I won't have to vomit out such a long and fragmented post like this anymore).

In general, a very, very good year. 2024 was a success, and let's hope that I can bring some real productivity to 2025.

Thanks for reading, Happy New Year!
