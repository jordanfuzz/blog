Hello again, I've had a lot going on with a hospital stay and being laid off at work, so I'll probably post something with more details soon, but in the meantime I wanted to share something brief.

Earlier today I came across a [thread](https://forum.melonland.net/index.php?topic=3101.15) on the [MelonLand Forum](https://forum.melonland.net/) (a nice little web-revival forum) and I ended up sharing something that had been on my mind a little bit recently. The thread was about hope, but recent posts had questioned how you can believe in a good God if there's so many horrible things happening.

I just finished watching the latest season of [The Chosen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1-FoFj8Jbo) and this post had me finally put some of these thoughts into words, and I wanted to record it here.

Also, that show is incredible, so go watch it. It's on most streaming services.

## So here's my post

I think something major that people seem to miss when questioning God's goodness in the midst of sorrow is that God has a much wider perspective than we have, and a greater understanding of what is to come.

If you offered someone a substantial sum of money with the catch that you would first flick them on the nose, most people would accept that deal in a heartbeat. That temporary discomfort would be nothing compared to the reward. But if you were to do the same to a six-month old baby, the baby would likely cry, and obviously wouldn't care about the money. In this scenario, the only thing the baby understands is the pain they just experienced. They wouldn't have any idea what the reward means, and would just be upset that something bad happened to them.

I think most of us are like the baby in this example, we only have the context of our current hardships, without the understanding of what better things await us. And therefore it's hard for us to accept the concept of a "perfectly good God" when there's suffering all around us.

For me, the God I personally believe in has made a promise of a heaven where things will be made right. And he promises that the joy and peace there will make even the greatest sorrow here seem very small in comparison. As a human, I don't even know what that means, but I believe that God does.

## Further conversation

I actually shared a similar analogy with my wife, who is not quite as religious as I am, and her response was, "Are you really going to compare horrors like murder and disease to a flick on the nose?"

**Yes, unapologetically.** I believe that after all of our suffering here is over, it really will seem so insignificant that we might even forget that it happened.

Thanks for reading.
