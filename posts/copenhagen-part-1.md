A short one.

My wife is currently living here in Denmark on a year-long work program. My work allows me to work here on visits, but I'm primarily living in the states during this time. I arrived last Friday for my first visit. Not my first time in Europe, but it is my first time in Denmark.

To keep this short, I'll just focus on a few highlights. I'm not much of a photographer so I'm kind of lacking in the photo department, but I have a couple.

## Food

> Smørrebrød

Best so far:

- Various pastries - Spandauer and cardamom rolls are my favorite.
- Sausages/Hot Dogs - They're everywhere, and they're all different.
- 7-Eleven Chicken Skewers - Incredible.
- Smørrebrød - More interesting than tasty, but still very good.

## People

One of the biggest things I've noticed here is how deliberately helpful people are. I've noticed that there's not really much small talk that happens, but that if you need something, people go out of their way to help you.

Part of working here required me to find a place to work during the evenings, and while I did a good amount of my own research, I had to ask for directions or recommendations from a few of the locals. One woman in particular offered to keep her cafe open an extra hour on days that I would work in her cafe.

## Holiday spirit

I love how festive it is here. There's little Christmas markets that pop up and so many windows have Christmas trees next to them. I also love how everyone here says Merry Christmas after any encounter. The main markets are a little touristy at this time of year, but that's kind of fun anyway.

## What's next

My family is coming next week to join my wife and I for Christmas, and we're going to travel around a little bit. We're planning on a short day trip to Sweden as well as spending Christmas in Finland with some family/friends we have there. I'll post photos and maybe another short update after that trip.
