# Blog

This repository holds the basic markdown files and photos for my blog that is currently only viewable on my just-for-fun [personal site](http://gloogo.io/).

Eventually this may house the clearner reader view version of the site.

This repository is updated using Obsidian.md and the Obsidian Git plugin.
